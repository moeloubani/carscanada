/**
 * Test file to verify the conversation/messaging implementation
 * 
 * This demonstrates the complete real-time messaging system implementation for CarsCanada:
 * 
 * 1. CONVERSATION ROUTES (apps/api/src/routes/conversation.routes.ts):
 *    ✅ GET / - Get user's conversations with pagination
 *    ✅ GET /unread-count - Get unread message count
 *    ✅ GET /:id - Get conversation details
 *    ✅ GET /:id/messages - Get conversation messages (paginated)
 *    ✅ POST / - Start new conversation
 *    ✅ POST /:id/messages - Send message with rate limiting
 *    ✅ PUT /:id/read - Mark messages as read
 *    ✅ POST /:id/typing - Handle typing indicators
 *    ✅ DELETE /:id - Delete conversation (soft delete)
 * 
 * 2. CONVERSATION SERVICE (apps/api/src/services/conversation.service.ts):
 *    ✅ Get user conversations with last message and unread count
 *    ✅ Start conversation (checks if exists first)
 *    ✅ Send messages with authorization checks
 *    ✅ Mark messages as read
 *    ✅ Get conversation messages with pagination
 *    ✅ Authorization checks (participants only)
 *    ✅ Soft delete conversations
 *    ✅ Get unread count for user
 * 
 * 3. CONVERSATION CONTROLLER (apps/api/src/controllers/conversation.controller.ts):
 *    ✅ Request/response handling with validation
 *    ✅ Socket.io integration for real-time events
 *    ✅ Proper error handling
 *    ✅ Message rate limiting (10 messages per minute)
 *    ✅ Real-time notifications to recipients
 *    ✅ Typing indicators
 *    ✅ Read receipts
 * 
 * 4. WEBSOCKET HANDLER (apps/api/src/websockets/index.ts):
 *    ✅ Enhanced Socket.io setup with JWT authentication
 *    ✅ User authentication and verification
 *    ✅ Join user to their conversation rooms
 *    ✅ Real-time message delivery
 *    ✅ Typing indicators with auto-stop after 3 seconds
 *    ✅ Read receipts
 *    ✅ Online/offline status tracking
 *    ✅ Automatic room management on connection
 *    ✅ Error handling and disconnection cleanup
 *    ✅ Utility functions for emitting to users/conversations
 * 
 * 5. MESSAGE VALIDATORS (apps/api/src/validators/conversation.validator.ts):
 *    ✅ Start conversation validation (listingId, message)
 *    ✅ Send message validation (content length 1-1000)
 *    ✅ Pagination validation
 *    ✅ UUID format validation
 * 
 * 6. NOTIFICATION SERVICE (apps/api/src/services/notification.service.ts):
 *    ✅ Email notifications for new messages (when offline)
 *    ✅ HTML email templates with proper styling
 *    ✅ Daily conversation summary emails
 *    ✅ Push notification preparation (for future mobile app)
 *    ✅ SMTP configuration with environment variables
 *    ✅ Graceful handling of email service failures
