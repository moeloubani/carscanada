# CarsCanada Railway Deployment Investigation Report

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Environment:** Production  
**Project ID:** 54c86933-b1bd-4b6c-8b98-02d9c4ddd39d  

## Issue Summary

The CarsCanada API service was experiencing deployment failures due to Redis connectivity issues. The API service was unable to connect to the Redis cache service using Railway's internal networking, causing the deployment to crash repeatedly.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Service Status Check**
   - Verified all 4 services in the project (PostgreSQL, Redis, API, Web)
   - Found PostgreSQL and Redis services running successfully
   - Discovered API service in CRASHED state
   - Web application successfully deployed

2. **Log Analysis**
   - Examined API deployment logs
   - Identified repeated DNS resolution failures for `carscanada-redis.railway.internal`
   - Error: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND carscanada-redis.railway.internal`

3. **Redis Configuration Investigation**
   - Checked Redis service configuration
   - Discovered Redis service had no TCP proxy configured
   - Railway's internal networking requires TCP proxy for service-to-service communication

4. **TCP Proxy Configuration**
   - Created TCP proxy for Redis service on port 6379
   - Proxy created at `metro.proxy.rlwy.net:17077`

5. **Environment Variable Update**
   - Updated `REDIS_URL` from internal URL to external proxy URL
   - Changed from: `redis://carscanada-redis.railway.internal:6379`
   - Changed to: `redis://metro.proxy.rlwy.net:17077`

6. **Service Restart and Monitoring**
   - Restarted API service multiple times
   - Monitored deployment progress
   - Observed intermittent connection issues (ECONNRESET errors)

## Findings

### Root Cause
The primary issue was the lack of proper Redis connectivity configuration for Railway's networking model. The API service was configured to use Railway's internal DNS (`carscanada-redis.railway.internal`), but:
1. The Redis service did not have a TCP proxy configured to enable internal networking
2. The internal DNS was not resolving properly

### Current Service Status

| Service | ID | Status | Issues |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| PostgreSQL Database | aebc482c-555c-418c-a420-e47914923788 | ✅ SUCCESS | None |
| Redis Cache | 35f9a590-b421-45dd-9f1a-17a6abc5eaef | ✅ SUCCESS | Connection instability |
| API Service | 95a658c4-a56e-49e8-a4a2-f29b1a08f068 | ✅ SUCCESS | Health endpoint returns 502 |
| Web Application | 55d1a74e-d9d5-4ecd-9a51-5099666dba60 | ✅ SUCCESS | Working (showing Next.js default page) |

### Endpoint Accessibility

- **Web Application**: `https://carscanada-web-production.up.railway.app` - ✅ Accessible (200 OK)
- **API Health Check**: `https://carscanada-api-production.up.railway.app/health` - ❌ Returns 502 Bad Gateway

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Created TCP Proxy for Redis**
   - Configured TCP proxy on port 6379
   - External access via `metro.proxy.rlwy.net:17077`

2. **Updated Environment Variables**
   - Modified `REDIS_URL` to use external proxy endpoint
   - This allowed the API service to connect to Redis

3. **Restarted Services**
   - Multiple restarts of the API service
   - Service now deploys successfully

## Remaining Issues

1. **API Health Endpoint**: The API service is deployed but the health endpoint returns 502, indicating the service may not be fully operational
2. **Redis Connection Instability**: Logs show intermittent ECONNRESET errors with Redis
3. **Web Application Content**: Currently showing default Next.js page instead of the actual application

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Infrastructure Configuration**
   - Use Railway's reference variables for service URLs (e.g., `${{REDIS_URL}}`)
   - Ensure all services requiring internal communication have appropriate TCP proxies configured
   - Document the required networking configuration for each service

2. **Monitoring and Health Checks**
   - Implement proper health check endpoints that verify all dependencies
   - Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff for Redis connections
   - Consider using connection pooling for Redis

3. **Deployment Process**
   - Create a deployment checklist that includes verifying all service dependencies
   - Test internal service connectivity before marking deployments as successful
   - Implement proper graceful shutdown handling for services

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Use environment-specific configuration files
   - Validate all required environment variables at startup
   - Consider using Railway's shared variables feature for common configurations

## Next Steps

1. Investigate why the API health endpoint returns 502 despite successful deployment
2. Review API service logs for startup errors
3. Verify database connectivity and migrations
4. Check if the API service is listening on the correct port (PORT environment variable)
5. Review the Redis connection implementation for proper error handling
6. Deploy the actual application code to replace the Next.js default page

## Conclusion

The deployment issues were primarily caused by misconfigured Redis networking in Railway's environment. While the services are now deploying successfully, there are still operational issues with the API service that need to be addressed. The Redis connection has been established but shows signs of instability that require further investigation and improved error handling in the application code.
