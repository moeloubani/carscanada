# CarsCanada Deployment Monitoring Report

**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Project ID**: 54c86933-b1bd-4b6c-8b98-02d9c4ddd39d  
**Environment**: Production (caebf5c1-bd27-4d99-a6e1-6f0b0c9821d2)  
**Monitored Commit**: 254fa17 - "Fix Railway deployment issues"

## Issue Summary

After pushing fixes for Railway deployment issues, the API service failed to deploy due to TypeScript compilation errors, while the Web application deployed successfully but cannot communicate with the backend API.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Deployment Check** (3:03 PM)
   - Found crashed API deployment from 1:56 PM showing Redis connection issues
   - Web application last successful deployment was from previous day

2. **Triggered New Deployments**
   - Attempted deployment with commit SHA 254fa17 - both services failed
   - Triggered deployments without specific commit SHA to use latest code
   - API Deployment ID: 5af8d764-aa0c-45e0-9f32-04d2358561be
   - Web Deployment ID: 60f61698-23be-41c1-a926-81712aa74bc8

3. **Deployment Results**
   - API Service: **FAILED** - TypeScript compilation errors
   - Web Application: **SUCCESS** - Deployed and accessible

4. **Endpoint Testing**
   - API Health Check (https://carscanada-api-production.up.railway.app/health): **502 Bad Gateway**
   - Web Application (https://carscanada-web-production.up.railway.app/): **200 OK**

## Findings

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors in API Service
The API build failed with two TypeScript errors:

```typescript
src/config/redis.ts(17,28): error TS7006: Parameter 'err' implicitly has an 'any' type.
src/server.ts(112,29): error TS2769: No overload matches this call.
  The last overload gave the following error.
    Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

**Analysis**:
- Line 17 in redis.ts: Missing type annotation for error parameter
- Line 112 in server.ts: PORT environment variable being passed as string instead of number

#### 2. Previous Redis Connection Issues
Before the TypeScript errors, the last successful build showed:
- Redis connecting successfully initially
- Immediate ECONNRESET errors after connection
- MaxRetriesPerRequestError after 20 retry attempts
- Service crash due to Redis connection failure

### Service Status

| Service | Status | Issue | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| API (carscanada-api) | ❌ FAILED | TypeScript compilation errors | No backend available |
| Web (carscanada-web) | ✅ SUCCESS | None | Running but no API connection |
| Database | Unknown | N/A | Cannot verify without API |
| Redis | Unknown | Previous connection issues | Cannot verify current state |

## Root Cause

The fixes pushed in commit 254fa17 introduced TypeScript errors that prevent the API from compiling:
1. Missing type annotation in Redis error handler
2. Type mismatch when parsing PORT environment variable

These must be fixed before the Redis connection improvements can be tested.

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix TypeScript Error in redis.ts (Line 17)**:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   redis.on('error', (err) => {
   
   // To:
   redis.on('error', (err: Error) => {
   ```

2. **Fix TypeScript Error in server.ts (Line 112)**:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
   
   // To:
   app.listen(parseInt(PORT), '0.0.0.0', () => {
   // OR use Number(PORT) or +PORT
   ```

3. **After fixing TypeScript errors**:
   - Commit and push the fixes
   - Trigger new deployment
   - Monitor Redis connection stability
   - Verify health endpoint responds correctly

### Configuration Verified

- PORT environment variable is set to "3001"
- Redis URL is configured: redis://metro.proxy.rlwy.net:17077
- Database URL is properly configured
- All required environment variables are present

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Pre-deployment Testing**
   - Run `npm run build` locally before pushing to ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
   - Add TypeScript build step to CI/CD pipeline if not already present

2. **Type Safety**
   - Enable strict TypeScript mode to catch these errors earlier
   - Add proper type definitions for all error handlers
   - Use type-safe environment variable parsing (e.g., using a validation library)

3. **Redis Connection**
   - After fixing TypeScript errors, monitor if the retry logic helps with connection stability
   - Consider adding health checks that test Redis connectivity
   - Implement graceful degradation if Redis is temporarily unavailable

## Current Status

- **Web Application**: ✅ Accessible and running
- **API Service**: ❌ Build failing due to TypeScript errors
- **User Impact**: Complete service outage - web app cannot communicate with backend
- **Next Steps**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors immediately and redeploy

## Conclusion

The deployment monitoring revealed that the fixes intended to resolve Railway deployment issues actually introduced TypeScript compilation errors that prevent the API from building. The web application deployed successfully but is non-functional without the backend API. The TypeScript errors are straightforward to fix and once resolved, the Redis connection improvements can be properly tested.
